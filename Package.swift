// MARK: - Dev-only tooling
//
// Dev-only tooling (the Persnoop swift-format linter and swift-docc-plugin) must not leak
// into downstream consumers' dependency graphs. A build-tool plugin attached to a shipping
// target follows that target into every consumer — as a forced "trust and enable" prompt in
// Xcode, not merely a wasted checkout. SwiftPM has no first-class dev dependencies, so gate
// them on a gitignored `.dev-tooling` sentinel, present only in this package's own working
// clone (and created as a step in CI, before the first resolve).
//
// `#filePath` anchors the lookup to this manifest's directory, independent of the current
// working directory. Attaching the plugin here, after the package is constructed, keeps the
// target list above free of gating noise.
//
// Toggling the sentinel on an already-evaluated package requires `swift package purge-cache`:
// SwiftPM caches the evaluated manifest keyed on its source text alone, so a gate that reads
// an external file is invisible to that cache key.
